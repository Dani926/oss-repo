## Reading Assignments
### How To Answer Questions in a Helpful way
1. Give insight into your thought process. The answers I learn from the most usually involve an explanation of the thought process behind the answer. If I did not come up with the answer myself its often because I am not used to thinking about a problem in a certain way. It is very helpful when an instructor or TA explains how they approached the problem.

2. Suggest alternative resources. I try to make a habit of always doing research before I ask a question, but sometimes I do not know where to look for answers or how to differentiate good resources from bad ones. It also happens that sometimes the way one resource explains something makes a lot more sense to me than the way another resource explained it, so if an instructor or TA can point me to resources that are trusted and/or have a different approach to explaining it can be very helpful.

### Free Culture - Chapter 3
To be honest, what I got most from reading this chapter was angry. Jesse appears to have done nothing wrong. He was using technology in the manner I think it is supposed to be used in, which is to make lives easier and solve problems. His actions seem to embody the very idea behind open source and it is upsetting that he was punished for it. The take away from this chapter, I think, is to be mindful of what the software you are making can be used for. Even if you are not doing anything illegal you can still end up facing consequences for how your users are interacting with the software.
